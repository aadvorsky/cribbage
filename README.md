# Poubelle Card Game
SE 339 Final Project

Basic three-person game called Poubelle, Garbage, or Trash with simple server to connect users.  The server will be built in Java with one thread per user. The server will store the most state of the game and the groups the users are in.  The users will send the updated game state when they make a move and otherwise wait until the game state has updated, upon which they will updated the UI.
